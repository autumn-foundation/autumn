# Migrating from Autumn `X.Y` to `X.Z`

> **Template.** Copy this file to `docs/migrations/next.md` with the first
> breaking change that lands after a release; it is renamed to
> `docs/migrations/<version>.md` when that release ships.
>
> **Delete this banner block in the copy** — and replace every `{placeholder}`
> with concrete content. `scripts/check-migration-guides.sh` fails on both.
>
> Delete sections that do not apply, **except** these six, which the gate
> requires and which must each have content under them:
> *At a glance*, *Summary*, *Before you start*, *Breaking changes*,
> *How to verify*, *Guide-only upgrade walkthrough*.
>
> Link the new file from [`docs/migrations/README.md`](README.md).

## At a glance

- **Old version:** `autumn-web {X.Y.Z}`
- **New version:** `autumn-web {X.Z.0}`
- **Expected upgrade effort:** {S / M / L — one paragraph of context}
- **MSRV delta:** `{old MSRV}` → `{new MSRV}` ({reason, or "unchanged"})
- **Carried dependency majors:** {e.g. `axum 0.8 → 0.9`, `diesel 2 → 3`,
  or "none"}

## Summary

One paragraph describing *why* this release is major. Prefer "we want
these properties, and they required breaking change `X`" over a list of
unrelated removals.

Link to the [CHANGELOG entry](../../CHANGELOG.md) for the release for the
full commit-level picture.

## Before you start

- Pin your existing version (`autumn-web = "={X.Y.Z}"`) and commit.
- Run `cargo update` *before* the upgrade so the subsequent diff is just
  the major bump.
- Make sure your test suite is green on the old version. You will want
  the safety net.

## Step-by-step

1. **Bump the dependency.**
   ```toml
   # Cargo.toml
   [dependencies]
   autumn-web = "{(X+1).0}"
   ```

2. **Run `cargo check`.** Work through the compiler errors section by
   section using the cheat sheet below.

3. **Apply configuration changes** (see
   [Configuration changes](#configuration-changes)).

4. **Run the test suite.**

5. **Run the application locally** and exercise each feature at least
   once. Pay attention to the [Behavior changes](#behavior-changes)
   section.

## Breaking changes

Repeat the block below for each breaking change. Keep changes grouped by
area (routing / config / database / …) so readers can skip to what they
care about.

### {Area}: {Short description}

**Why:** One or two sentences on the motivation.

**Before (`{X.Y}`):**

```rust
// paste a minimal, compiling example from the old version
```

**After (`{(X+1).0}`):**

```rust
// paste the equivalent on the new version
```

**If you are automating the upgrade:** optional `sed`/`rg` one-liner or
note about a `cargo fix --edition`-style tool if one applies.

## Compiler error cheat sheet

Paste the most common errors a user will hit and the fix. This is the
single most valuable section of the guide — keep it factual and short.

| Error message (truncated) | Where you see it | Fix |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----|
| `error[E0432]: unresolved import \`autumn_web::foo\`` | module reorganized | `use autumn_web::bar;` |
| `error[E0061]: this function takes 2 arguments but 1 was supplied` | `App::run` added a parameter | see [Breaking changes › {Area}] |

## Configuration changes

- `autumn.toml` keys that were renamed, removed, or have new defaults.
- New `AUTUMN_*` environment variables.
- Default profile changes.

If nothing changed, delete this section.

## Behavior changes

Changes that still compile but behave differently at runtime. Examples:

- Error responses adopted a new JSON shape.
- A default middleware is now ordered differently.
- A scheduled task now runs on a different worker.

If nothing changed, delete this section.

## Deprecations retained from `{X.Y}`

Items that were deprecated during the `{X.Y}` line and have now been
removed. Link each to the release where the deprecation notice first
appeared so users can see how much warning they had.

### Config-key removals

Config keys removed in this major release were registered in
`DEPRECATED_CONFIG_KEYS` (`autumn/src/config.rs`) with `remove_in = "{X+1}.0.0"`.
Startup issued a `WARN` log entry for each deprecated key detected in the config
(via `since = "{X.Y}"`), and `autumn doctor` surfaced them in the
`deprecated_keys` check.

For each removed config key, fill in the table below:

| Removed key (TOML / env var) | Replacement | Deprecated since | References |
|------------------------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| `section.old_key` / `AUTUMN_SECTION__OLD_KEY` | `section.new_key` | `{X.Y}.0` | (link to changelog) |

If no config keys were removed, delete this subsection.

## Upstream dependency updates

For each major dependency bump carried with this release:

- Link to that project's upstream migration notes.
- Call out any of their changes that leak through Autumn's public API.

If no majors were carried, delete this section.

## How to verify

The reader's proof the upgrade landed. Keep it to concrete, checkable steps —
commands with expected output, not "make sure everything works". Required by
`scripts/check-migration-guides.sh`.

1. `cargo check` — clean, with none of the errors in the cheat sheet above.
2. `cargo test` — the suite is green on the new version.
3. `autumn doctor --strict` — no findings.
4. {one step per breaking change: the observable behaviour that proves the fix
   was applied, e.g. "hit `/x` and confirm the response carries `Y`"}

### Guide-only upgrade walkthrough

Upgrade an app scaffolded with `autumn new` on the **previous** release using
only this guide — no changelog, no source reading — and record the result here
before publishing to crates.io. See
[`docs/release-checklist.md`](../release-checklist.md), *Migration Guide Gate*.

- **Status:** {`performed YYYY-MM-DD` once done — `pending` is accepted only
  while this file is still `next.md`}
- **From → to:** `autumn-cli {X.Y.Z}` app upgraded to `autumn-web {X.Z.0}`
- **Elapsed:** {minutes — the success metric is under 30}
- **Gaps found and fixed in this guide:** {none, or what the walk-through
  exposed}

## Troubleshooting

Known rough edges, workarounds, and known-good version combinations
(e.g. "use `diesel 2.2.5+` — earlier `2.2.x` releases have a known
`pq-sys` linkage issue on macOS").

## Reporting problems

If you hit something not covered here, please open an issue at
<https://github.com/autumn-foundation/autumn/issues> with:

- The error message or unexpected behavior.
- The old version you upgraded from.
- A minimal reproduction if possible.

Migration guides are living documents — we update them based on user
reports for the first few months after a major release.
